LibAddonMenu-2.0
-> Please install this library like a normal addon to your "AddOns" folder (standalone installation), or use the Minion addon manager to install and update the needed library properly.

Do you remember that moment as you find a nice chest somehwere but then you realize that you don't have any lockpicks left in your pocket?
And the next moment some other player appears and loots this chest right in front of you?

This simple addon gives you the possibility to colorize the "lockpicks left" information that you see at the bottom line, if you are lockpicking a chest.
The colors can be changed according to a number of lockpicks that you have left in your inventory (threshold values).

The next chest you will lockpick will give you the visual information now, if you need to get some new lockpicks to your pocket.

In addition the addon is able to show you visual helpers during your lockpicking:
A green check icon will be shown each time a chamber of the current lockpick progress was picked and you need to release your mouse button!
You are able to colorize the lock's springs green as they get resolved.
